<#
.SYNOPSIS
Deploys a built RockWeb artifact to a named long-lived environment (staging, production).

.DESCRIPTION
Runs on a Windows IIS host through the environment command queue, the same
control plane the PR test environments use. Two modes:

  DedicatedSite  Creates/updates its own IIS site and app pool, exactly like a PR
                 environment but keyed by name instead of PR number. Used for
                 staging on the test VM.

  InPlace        Updates an existing IIS site's files without recreating the site
                 or its bindings. Used for production, where the site, host
                 headers, certificate, and uploaded content already exist and
                 must survive the deploy. Takes a full backup first and refuses
                 to do anything unless -Apply is passed.

Both modes are idempotent for a given environment name.

.NOTES
DedicatedSite writes its manifest under $EnvironmentRoot (default C:\RockTestEnvs)
so Invoke-PrEnvironmentCertificateRenewal.ps1 discovers and renews its Let's
Encrypt certificate with no extra configuration -- that script keys off
hostName/siteName in env.json, not off a PR number.

InPlace deliberately writes its manifest somewhere else, so a certificate
renewal run on the test VM can never reach a production site.

# On the sixteen parameters below, and why they are still sixteen.
#
# Card 08 of the 2026-08-21 architecture review read this block as a shallow
# interface and proposed replacing it with a Target the caller names once,
# carrying only the fields belonging to its own mode. That was not taken, and the
# reason belongs here rather than in a commit message nobody will find:
#
#   PowerShell has no discriminated union to express "these four fields, but only
#   in DedicatedSite". The one runtime caller,
#   Invoke-PrEnvironmentCommandQueue.ps1, assembles a hashtable from untyped queue
#   JSON and splats it -- so a Target type would sit between an untyped hashtable
#   on one side and a flat parameter list on the other, translating without
#   checking anything. That is a layer, not a seam.
#
# What the card was actually reaching for was the mode logic, which was thirty
# lines of top-level script that nothing could call. That is now
# Resolve-DeploymentTarget, with Pester tests that call it, and it refuses the
# mode mismatch the flat list used to swallow: DedicatedSite accepted
# TargetSitePath and TargetAppPoolName and silently dropped them, so an operator
# could dispatch a deploy naming a directory, watch it report success, and get a
# different one. The depth went behind the function. The parameter list stayed
# where every caller and every runbook already expects it.

        .DESCRIPTION
        The agent uploads this script's output as the deploy's only durable record.
        Every deploy-staging-* object in the bucket is 435 bytes, which is the
        header and nothing else -- the script printed its parameters and then went
        quiet for the eleven minutes that mattered.

        Absolute UTC because the reader is correlating against GCS object times, a
        Cloud SQL restore point and an IIS log, none of which are in local time.
        Elapsed alongside it because "which step took nine minutes" is the question
        actually being asked, and subtracting timestamps by hand at 2am is how the
        wrong step gets blamed.

# Directories the artifact must never overwrite or delete. Content and uploaded
# files live only on the server -- they are user data, not build output. App_Data
# holds the Rock cache and the migration lock. Logs are forensic evidence.
#
# This binds on the InPlace branch only, and the asymmetry is deliberate rather
# than an oversight. InPlace copies the artifact over a live webroot, so it hands
# this list to robocopy as /XD exclusions for both the backup and the copy and
# the directories are never touched. DedicatedSite deletes $SitePath outright and
# moves the extracted artifact into its place, so nothing named here survives a
# staging or pr-* deploy. Only $PreservedFiles is carried across that replace, by
# hand, through $preservedStash.
#
# What makes that acceptable is where the data actually lives. Every binary file
# in this install is in S3 through the pillars storage provider, so Content and
# Uploads on a dedicated site hold nothing the bucket does not also hold, and
# App_Data is a cache Rock rebuilds at startup. Logs is the one with a real cost:
# a staging deploy destroys the evidence of whatever went wrong on the previous
# one, which matters when a deploy is being run to chase a fault rather than to
# ship. Anyone who needs those logs must copy them off the box first.
$PreservedDirectories = @('Content', 'App_Data', 'Logs', 'Uploads')

# Files that are per-server configuration, not build output.
$PreservedFiles = @('web.ConnectionStrings.config')

# Directories the server owns and the branch does not, even though the artifact
# ships its own copy of them. The artifact's copy is the wrong one and must lose.
#
# Font Awesome is the case that forced this. Passion holds a Pro licence and the
# Pro webfonts sit on both boxes, but upstream Rock ships the Free fonts under
# the same filenames, so the artifact always carries a Free
# fa-solid-900.woff2 (78 KB against Pro's 137 KB) and a Free fa-regular-400.woff2
# (13 KB against Pro's 169 KB). Free covers about 1,600 glyphs where Pro covers
# more than 16,000, so every Pro-only icon on a page falls back to an empty box.
# The fonts cannot be committed instead: this repository is a public fork of
# SparkDevNetwork/Rock, and publishing licensed commercial font binaries to it
# would breach the licence and be unrecoverable once pushed.
#
# fa-light-300.woff2 is the tell that the plain overlay cannot solve this on its
# own. Free has no Light weight, so no Light file rides in the artifact, the gap
# is real, and Sync-SharedSiteAssets fills it -- Light matches production byte
# for byte today. Solid and Regular are already present at the destination when
# the overlay runs, and /XC /XN /XO means it skips anything already there. Only
# an authoritative copy can replace them.
#
# Both deployment modes need this and they need opposite mechanisms, which is why
# the list lives here rather than inside either branch:
#
#   DedicatedSite  Sync-ServerOwnedAssets copies these from the base site after
#                  the gap-filling overlay, with no /XC /XN /XO, so the box wins.
#   InPlace        the same paths become robocopy /XD exclusions, so the artifact
#                  never reaches them and production keeps what it already has.
#
# Production has never had an automated deploy -- its fa-solid-900.woff2 is dated
# 2021-08-04 and its _variables.less 2023-04-10 -- so the v19 cutover is the first
# run that could overwrite these, and without the exclusion it would.
#
# Forward slashes: Join-Path handles them on Windows, and they read as paths
# rather than as escapes.
$ServerOwnedDirectories = @('Assets/Fonts/FontAwesome')

# The same problem one level down: files the organisation owns that sit inside
# directories the artifact owns. These two are server-owned for a reason that has
# nothing to do with this pipeline -- Rock writes them itself. The Theme Styler
# block saves both with File.WriteAllText (RockWeb/Blocks/Cms/ThemeStyler.ascx.cs,
# lines 134 and 249), so they hold whatever an administrator last did in Admin
# Tools. A file the running application writes cannot also be owned by the
# artifact, or every deploy silently reverts an administrator's work. Content and
# Uploads are on the preserved list for the same reason.
#
# Measured against production on 2026-08-26 by hand: eight of these files across
# five themes differ from what the artifact ships -- Rock, Stark, LandingPage,
# CheckinElectric and DashboardStark. They carry the brand palette
# (@brand-color: #00b8e4, the link colours, @brand-critical), the Pro Font
# Awesome wiring, and hand-written CSS fixes. Only Themes/Rock/Styles/
# _variable-overrides.less matches the repository, because at some point someone
# copied that one file into the fork.
#
# That hand count was low, and the gap is the argument for discovering these off
# the box instead of listing them here. The first run against staging restored 46
# files across 23 themes. Most of the extra are themes the fork has no folder for
# at all -- PassionCityChurch, PassionTeam, CONNECT, Connect-V2, Agency,
# CustomDefault, KioskStark and a family of Checkin-* variants -- and they are not
# trivial: PassionCityChurch/_css-overrides.less alone is 10122 bytes. Anything
# enumerated in this file would have missed every one of them.
#
# Both modes lost them, in opposite directions:
#
#   InPlace        robocopy /E copies whenever source and destination differ, and
#                  nothing excluded these, so the v19 cutover would have replaced
#                  them with upstream's empty pair.
#   DedicatedSite  the overlay runs /XC /XN /XO and skips anything the artifact
#                  already placed, so it never delivered them. That is why staging
#                  renders in stock Rock blue, and why its Stark login page -- the
#                  first screen anyone sees -- does not match production either.
#
# This also decides whether the Font Awesome exclusion above achieves anything.
# Restoring the Pro .woff2 binaries is half the job: the compiled CSS only asks
# for the Pro faces because _variable-overrides.less sets @fa-edition and calls
# .fa-font-face for the regular and light weights. Lose the override and the Pro
# fonts sit on disk unreferenced.
#
# The cost of this, stated plainly: the box is now authoritative for these eight
# files, so editing one in the repository will not change production. Change them
# through Admin Tools > CMS > Themes, which is what writes them. The repository's
# copy of Themes/Rock/Styles/_variable-overrides.less is a snapshot, not the
# delivery path.
#
# Which themes have these files is read off the box rather than listed here.
# Get-ServerOwnedThemeFilePaths only returns paths that exist, so a theme v19
# adds and the box has never seen still gets its file from the artifact -- and it
# needs to, because theme.less imports the file unconditionally and a theme
# missing it does not compile at all.
$ServerOwnedThemeFiles = @('_variable-overrides.less', '_css-overrides.less')

# The same problem one level further in again: web.config belongs to the artifact,
# but a handful of values inside it belong to the box. Merge-ServerOwnedWebConfigSettings
# carries these across; its help explains what each one costs if it is lost, and
# why the file itself cannot simply go on $PreservedFiles instead.
#
# Measured against production 2026-09-14: all four differ from the artifact, which
# is byte-identical to unaltered upstream and so ships Rock's stock values.

function Set-WarmSiteSettings {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Stop IIS from putting the site to sleep, and have it start Rock unprompted.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Until 2026-08-26 the deploy set an app pool's runtime version and identity
        and left every other IIS default standing. Those defaults suit a shared host
        running many small sites. Rock is the opposite shape: one application that
        spends a minute and a half rebuilding its caches before it can answer, and
        then answers in a quarter of a second.

        Staging measured 16.07s for a first request and 0.25s for the next one that
        day. Nothing about the machine changed between those two numbers. IIS had
        ended the worker process after twenty idle minutes and the first visitor
        paid for a whole Rock start.

        Separate from Ensure-AppPool because production reaches this and does not
        reach that. An InPlace deploy updates a site somebody else built, so it has
        no business restating that site's identity or rebinding it -- but the pool
        can still be told not to sleep. Splitting the two is what lets the warm
        settings apply in both modes.

        Every property here is written every deploy rather than checked first. The
        settings are the deploy's to own, and a pool somebody adjusted by hand in
        the IIS console should come back to this on the next run.

    .PARAMETER AppPoolName
        The pool to hold resident. Must already exist.

    .PARAMETER SiteName
        The site to preload. Optional: pass nothing to configure the pool alone.

        'C:\extract\Themes/Rock/Styles/x.less' -- mixed, and handed to robocopy
        as an /XF or /XD argument.

        Windows resolves mixed separators when it opens a file, so the copy source
        would still be found. Exclusion matching is the part that is not worth
        assuming: a /XF that quietly fails to match copies the artifact's stock
        file over production's during the cutover, and robocopy reports success
        either way. Normalising costs one call and removes the question.

        String.Replace rather than -replace, and the reason is worth recording.
        The regex form needs the separator escaped to survive the pattern, and
        Regex::Escape on a backslash returns two characters -- which a
        replacement string takes literally, so every separator comes back
        doubled. That is a worse path than the mixed one this exists to fix. A
        plain character replace has no such trap.

function Set-ProductionCompilationSettings {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Turn ASP.NET debug mode off in a web.config, and pin the execution timeout.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Applied on the server rather than committed to RockWeb/web.config, for two
        reasons. Upstream owns that file and edits it most releases, so a fork-local
        change there conflicts at every merge and can be resolved away in silence.
        And debug="true" is the right setting for a developer running Rock out of
        Visual Studio -- it is only wrong on a server.

        Doing it here also means Rock's own in-application update process cannot
        leave it reverted: Rock Update rewrites web.config, and the next deploy puts
        this back.

        Measured on production 2026-08-26 with debug still on. ASP.NET was serving
        MicrosoftAjax.debug.js at 320KB where the release build is roughly 100KB,
        and a 414KB script bundle unminified at 45 characters per line. Bundling was
        already happening; minification is what debug="true" turns off. Worth 400 to
        500KB of a 3.26MB page. The Obsidian ES modules are unaffected either way.

        The timeout is not optional. debug="true" sets the execution timeout to
        30,000,000 seconds, so the 110 second default has never applied here.
        Turning debug off brings it back, and a cold Rock start was measured at 95
        to 107 seconds -- close enough that a slow morning would surface as a
        request timeout on a site that is working. Both settings move together or
        neither does, which is why one function does both.

        A pure string transform so it can be tested without IIS, a server, or a
        file on disk.

    .PARAMETER WebConfig
        The contents of web.config.

    .PARAMETER ExecutionTimeoutSeconds
        Seconds to allow one request. The default also covers the first request
        after a deploy, when Rock runs its EF and plugin migrations inline.

function Merge-ServerOwnedWebConfigSettings {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Carry the settings this server owns out of its existing web.config and
        into the artifact's, returning the merged file.

    .DESCRIPTION
        web.config cannot go on $PreservedFiles and cannot be copied over blindly
        either, which is why this exists rather than a one-line list entry.

        Not preserved: 19.3.4 changes 376 lines of web.config against 18.4.1, and
        nearly all of them are bindingRedirect bumps -- WebGrease to 5.2.9,
        Newtonsoft to 6.0.0, the Google API assemblies to 1.69.0.0. Keep the box's
        file and v19's own assemblies do not load.

        Not copied: measured against production on 2026-09-14, every value named
        below differs between the live box and the artifact. RockWeb/web.config is
        byte-identical to unaltered upstream, so the artifact carries Rock's stock
        distribution values; production's were set by hand on the server and have
        never matched any branch, 18.4.1 included.

        So: artifact as the base, with the server-owned values written back over
        the top. The same principle as $ServerOwnedDirectories and
        $ServerOwnedThemeFiles, one level further in -- the file belongs to the
        artifact, a handful of values inside it belong to the box.

        A pure transform, like Set-ProductionCompilationSettings, so it is
        testable without IIS, a server, or a file on disk.

        What each carried value costs if it is lost:

          PasswordKey          Rock/Security/Authentication/Database.cs hashes
                               every database password with it. A different key
                               validates no existing password, so every staff
                               login fails at once -- including the login needed
                               to go and fix it.
          DataEncryptionKey    Rock/Security/Encryption.cs. Encrypted attribute
                               values, financial gateway credentials among them,
                               stop decrypting. Nothing fails at startup; it
                               surfaces the first time a gateway is called.
          RunJobsInIISContext  Production runs Quartz inside the IIS worker
                               process and sets this True. Upstream ships False.
                               Flipping it stops every scheduled job, silently.
          OrgTimeZone          Production names the zone; upstream says Local.
                               Harmless while the VM is Eastern Standard Time,
                               which it is today, and wrong the moment that stops
                               being true.
          machineKey           Travels as a whole element: the two keys are a pair
                               and the algorithm attributes belong with them.
                               Losing it drops every signed-in session and fails
                               ViewState validation mid-postback.
          tagPrefix            Production registers tagPrefix="Passion"
                               assembly="com.passioncitychurch", and three live
                               registration pages under Plugins\passion\crm use
                               it. They are .ascx with CodeFile=, so they compile
                               on first request: drop the registration and all
                               three yellow-screen, with nothing before the first
                               visitor to say so.

        OldPasswordKey is matched by prefix rather than named. Rock reads
        OldPasswordKey, OldPasswordKey1, OldPasswordKey2 and so on in order so that
        a key rotation does not lock out anyone whose hash predates it, and how
        many exist is not knowable from here.

        Anything else the server has and the artifact does not is reported, not
        moved. A key this list does not name is either one upstream dropped on
        purpose or one nobody has justified keeping; naming it here is how it
        survives, and a silent catch-all would carry both kinds forward forever.

    .PARAMETER IncomingWebConfig
        The artifact's web.config: the base, and the winner for everything not
        named here.

    .PARAMETER ExistingWebConfig
        The web.config already on the server, read before the copy destroys it.
        Empty means there was none, and the incoming file comes back unchanged.

    .PARAMETER AppSettingKeys
        appSettings keys to carry across by exact name.

    .PARAMETER AppSettingKeyPrefixes
        appSettings keys to carry across by prefix, for families whose members
        cannot be listed in advance.
