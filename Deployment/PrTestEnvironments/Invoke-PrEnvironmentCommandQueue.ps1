        .DESCRIPTION
        The background job's output is not a reliable record. Measured on the
        staging rehearsal of 2026-08-25: deploy-staging-32794680054-1 ran 15m24s,
        reported success, and produced a 916-byte log that stops at "Stopping app
        pool" -- the first line of the window in which the site is offline. The
        remaining twelve minutes covered the site replace, the ACL grant, the
        preserved-file restore, the app pool start and the health check, all of
        which ran, because a success result requires reaching the end of the deploy
        script.

        It was not redaction, the character cap, a timeout, a preference change, a
        stale script or a second agent instance; each was ruled out in turn. The
        job stream itself drops records, and the mechanism is still unexplained.

        So the deploy also writes its timeline to a file, and this function puts
        that file back into the uploaded log. It is deliberately indifferent to why
        the stream lost the records, because a production cutover should not be
        waiting on that answer.

        Both halves of the queue need the identical rule: the producer redacts what
        it echoes into a public Actions log, the agent redacts what it uploads to
        the bucket, and a field name nobody has invented yet has to be covered by
        both without either being edited. Copied rather than shared, because no

function Complete-QueuedCommand {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Report a command's result and make sure that command cannot run again.

    .DESCRIPTION
        The object in pending/ is the only record of a command being outstanding.
        The agent lists that prefix every sixty seconds and takes whatever it finds,
        so a command is retired by being deleted and by nothing else.

        This used to be two bare statements, the write first, under an
        $ErrorActionPreference of 'Stop'. Any failure of the write skipped the
        delete, so a transient 503 -- nothing misconfigured, nothing anyone did --
        left the command pending and ran it again a minute later, and again, for as
        long as the host stayed up. On a deploy that means re-extracting the site
        and re-entering migrations underneath a run already in progress.

        So the two halves are independent now, and the delete happens whether or not
        the report did. Reporting failure costs the dispatching workflow a timeout
        with no result: a false red on work that ran exactly once, recoverable by
        reading a log. The behaviour it replaces is recoverable by nothing.

        The proper fix is a claim marker -- move the object to processing/ before
        running it, which is what the unused $ProcessingPrefix was reserved for.
        That changes the contract shared with the enqueue and wait actions, so it is
        deliberately not being done days before a production cutover.

        The sections of a contract row that bind no field.

        .DESCRIPTION
        Named beside the binding kinds for the same reason those are named: the
        binder refuses a section it does not recognise, so every section that is
        deliberately not a binding has to be listed somewhere, and a list written
        out inside the binder is one the tests cannot ask for.

            Script          The file to run, a bare name joined onto $DeployRoot.
            TimeoutSeconds  How long the background job may take.
            Unreachable     Script parameters a queued document is not allowed to
                            set, by name, so that the set of parameters is
                            accounted for rather than merely partly listed.

        Unreachable is the one that earns a section of its own. Deploy-RockEnvironment.ps1
        takes seventeen parameters and this table reached thirteen of them; the
        other four were not a decision recorded anywhere, they were the absence of
        one. A parameter added to a deployment script and never wired here looks
        exactly like a parameter deliberately left on its default, and the first
        reader to notice is an operator who wants to set it during an incident.
        Naming them turns the sweep in CommandContract.Tests.ps1 into a real
        question: every parameter is bound, or it is listed here with a reason.

function Get-CommandContract {
    <#
        .SYNOPSIS
        What one queued verb runs, how long it may take, and how the fields of a
        queued document reach that script's parameters.

        .DESCRIPTION
        Adding a verb used to take four edits in four places -- a timeout table, a
        switch arm inside the background job, the secret list, and the producer's
        payload -- and nothing asserted that the four agreed. Three of those are one
        row here. The fourth stopped being a list when redaction moved to keying on
        the shape of a field name, so a new secret-shaped field needs no edit at all.

        Commands run inside a background job with a per-command timeout. Without
        one, a command that hangs -- a certificate renewal blocked on win-acme, say
        -- never returns, so this once-per-minute task, which Windows will not start
        a second instance of while one is running, wedges and stops processing every
        other command. The poll loop in the queueing workflow then times out with no
        result instead of seeing a real failure. On timeout the job is killed and a
        failed result is written, keeping the queue healthy and the workflow
        informed. Each TimeoutSeconds is kept comfortably under its own workflow's
        poll window so the workflow reports the failure rather than timing out first.

        The binding kinds are a vocabulary, not a convenience. Each is a rule about
        what a missing or blank value means, and the versions written out by hand
        inside the job disagreed with one another:

            Required  Present and non-blank, or the command is refused by name.
            Optional  Forwarded when present and non-blank. Absent means "leave the
                      script's own default alone" -- which is how a production
                      deploy omits connectionString and keeps the one on the box.
            Flag      Forwarded as $true when present and truthy, omitted otherwise.
                      A switch that has to be asked for, which is what makes -Apply
                      a dry run by default.
            List      One comma-separated field split into an array. The queued
                      document stays a flat map of scalars like every other field,
                      so a hand-written command is still hand-writable.
            Verbatim  Forwarded whenever the property exists, empty or not. Only for
                      a field whose empty value means something -- clearing a block
                      rather than omitting it.
            Runtime   Not from the document at all: a value this agent knows and the
                      script needs. The key names the value, the value names the
                      parameter.

        Beside those, each row carries an Unreachable list: script parameters a
        queued document may not set, named so that the row accounts for the whole
        signature rather than describing part of it. See Get-CommandContractSection
        for why that is a section and not a comment, and CommandContract.Tests.ps1
        for the sweep that holds every row to it.

        The table lives inside a function because the Pester suites read functions
        out of these scripts rather than running them -- see Import-ScriptFunction.
        A hashtable at script scope would be unreachable, which is how the old one
        went unchecked.

        Script is a bare file name, joined onto $DeployRoot by the caller. The
        bootstrap copies Deployment/PrTestEnvironments and Deployment/Database into
        the same directory on the box, so two of these live in a different folder in
        this repository than they do on the VM.

        .PARAMETER Command
        The verb to look up. Omit it for the whole table, which is what the tests
        sweep.

        One comma-separated field of a queued document, as an array.

        .DESCRIPTION
        Written out twice word for word before this existed -- once for the
        anonymizer's keep list and once for the theme's variable assignments.

        Comma-separated rather than a JSON array so that the queued document stays a
        flat map of scalars like every other field, and so that a hand-written
        command is still hand-writable.

        Blanks are dropped and an all-blank value yields nothing, which is what lets
        the caller read "nothing survived" as "the field was not stated".

        The raw field value.

    <#
        .SYNOPSIS
        The script one queued command runs, and the arguments to splat at it.

        .DESCRIPTION
        This was a switch inside the scriptblock handed to Start-Job, which put it in
        a different runspace from every test in this repository: nothing could call
        it, so what it did was asserted by matching the text of its own source. The
        payload-to-argument step was written out five times, the comma-split list
        parser twice word for word, and three different rules governed a blank value
        with nothing saying which was meant where.

        Binding here rather than inside the job also moves a refusal to before the
        job starts, into the loop's own try, so a command the agent will not run
        comes back as a failed result carrying the reason rather than as a job that
        died.

        .PARAMETER Command
        The parsed command document.

        .PARAMETER DeployRoot
        Where the agent keeps the deployment scripts. A Runtime value, and also what
        the caller joins the returned Script onto.

        .PARAMETER StepLogPath
        The deploy timeline this command should write, for the one contract that asks
        for it.
