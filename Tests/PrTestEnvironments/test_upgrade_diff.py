"""A Rock upgrade can move a file from committed to generated, and nothing notices.

Every other check in this suite re-derives its facts from the *current* checkout. That
is the right shape for almost all of them, and it is exactly the wrong shape for a
trunk cutover, because a path that quietly stops existing looks like a perfectly
ordinary tree. It is only wrong relative to the version we came from, and until this
module nothing in CI held that comparison.

Three v19 incidents came out of that one blind spot, each found in production by
symptom rather than by a check:

  RockWeb/Styles/styles-v2/      178 tracked files -> 1, plus a .gitignore of `*`.
                                 Found when the dashboard rendered unstyled.
  Rock.Version/AssemblySharedInfo.cs   deleted; the version moved to Directory.Build.props.
                                 Found when the production version guard read a file
                                 that was not there.
  The legacy-column workflow     deleted upstream (item 26). Found weeks later during
                                 an unrelated audit.

All three are mechanically detectable before the cutover, from nothing but two refs.

The tests here are on the pure functions, fed hand-written file lists, because the
interesting cases are the ones no ref pair in this repository currently exhibits --
a directory that empties to zero, a deleted path named only in a PowerShell string
with backslashes, a migration whose UPDATE spans two lines. Pinning those to real refs
would mean the tests only cover whatever the last upgrade happened to do. One test at
the bottom does run against the real 18.4.1 -> 19.3.4 pair, as a check that the pure
functions are wired to git correctly and still find the incident they were written for.
