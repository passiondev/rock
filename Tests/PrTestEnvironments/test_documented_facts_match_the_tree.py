"""Facts the documentation states, re-derived from the thing that owns them.

`test_trap7_counts_match_the_tree.py` already makes this bargain for one section
of one guide: keep the concrete number in the prose where it is useful, and let
the suite carry the burden of keeping it true. The bargain worked. The gap was
that it covered one file, and the same numbers are stated in others -- so the
WebForms block count sat at 448 in the open-items document, as a present-tense
measurement, while the tree held 353 and the guide that was pinned said so.

Every fact below is derived, never hard-coded. A number written here would be a
fifth copy of the thing this file exists to stop.
