"""One reader for the Rock version a checkout declares.

Two deploy guards refuse a deploy whose Rock minor does not match what the target
is already running: production-deploy.yml against the branch `productionBranch`
pins, staging-deploy.yml against the catalog the pr-* fleet shares. Rock migrates
its database on the first request after a deploy, so both of them are the last
thing between a mismatched artifact and an irreversible migration.

Each one read the version itself. They probed the two candidate files in opposite
orders, with different sed expressions, and each carried a comment explaining why
its own order was the correct one -- production's pinned oldest-first by
test_environment_deploy.py, staging's pinned newest-first by a test in
test_staging_catalog_version_guard.py asserting the exact opposite. Neither test
failed, because on this tree only one of the two files exists and any order
returns the same answer. The disagreement was real and the tree was hiding it.

Settling it: props first. The orders differ only where both files carry a version,
and the way that happens here is a 19.x tree that still has an
AssemblySharedInfo.cs -- one plausible build fix away, since Rock.Client,
Rock.Mandrill and CheckScannerUtility still <Compile Include> the file Rock 19
deleted and pr-test-artifact.yml works around it by excluding the project. Under
oldest-first, that tree reads 18.x: production refuses every deploy, and staging
matches an 18.x pin and lets a 19.x artifact migrate the 18.x catalog, which is
the incident the staging guard was written after.

The oldest-first argument was that 18.x ships a Directory.Build.props carrying no
<Version>, so the historical path has to be probed first for an 18.x ref to answer
18.x. True premise, and the conclusion does not follow: with no <Version> to find,
props-first falls through to the attribute and answers 18.x too.

These tests run the reader rather than matching its source. A shape assertion is
what both guards already had, and what they had was two shapes.
