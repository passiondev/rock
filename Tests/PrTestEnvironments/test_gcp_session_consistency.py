"""One Google Cloud session, opened one way, by every workflow that needs one.

Card 06 of the 2026-08-21 architecture review counted nine byte-identical
`auth@v2` + `setup-gcloud@v2` pairs and proposed a local composite action. This
module first argued against it, on the grounds that `uses: ./...` loads from the
checkout and five of the nine callers never checked out. That was wrong, and it
is worth saying why, because the mistake is easy to repeat: the check was run
against the tree as it stood *before* the same review's card 02 landed. Card 02
moved the enqueue and the wait into composite actions, which forced a checkout
into three of those five workflows. By the time the rebuttal was written, seven of
the nine already checked out, an eighth checked out later in the same job, and the
ninth needed one sparse checkout of a single directory.

So the action exists, at `.github/actions/gcp-session`, and what this module holds
changed with it. Byte-identity across nine copies is no longer a thing to test --
there is one copy. What replaces it is the cost the action brought in: a local
action is loaded from disk, so every caller now needs a checkout that runs first
*and* reaches the action's directory. Neither requirement appears in the `with:`
block, and neither fails at parse time. A sparse checkout that omits one directory
gets an "action not found" several minutes into a deploy, and only on the branch
where somebody added the caller.

The bucket expression is a separate claim from the same card, and it holds for
most of what it covers. All twelve remaining uses sit in a job-level `env:` block,
which GitHub evaluates before any step runs -- so a step output there resolves to
the empty string and every `gsutil` path silently becomes `gs:///...`, a deploy
that writes nowhere and reports success. No accessor can reach those. They stay,
and the identity test below is what holds them together.

The count was wrong here for a while, and the correction is worth keeping: it read
"eleven of fourteen" when the real split was ten of fourteen. The other four were
not load-bearing at all. Three sat in `run:` bodies in the bootstrap workflow and
one in a `github-script` body in the deploy workflow, and every one of them could
read a name the job had already declared. They now do, which is where twelve comes
from. The test below pins the shape rather than the number, so the next copy in a
`run:` body fails on the spot instead of being counted as one of the unavoidable
ones.
