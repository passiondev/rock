"""What every test in this suite needs before it can assert anything.

Thirty-three files opened with the same four lines: resolve the repository root,
name a file under it, read the text, parse the YAML. Four of them also sliced a
PowerShell function body out by hand, and each slice was spelled slightly
differently. None of that is the thing under test, and repeating it is how the
suite ended up with assertions that cannot fail -- `assertIn("SecurityProtocol",
text)` against a 918-line script passes while the two sites that set it are
deleted, because a comment mentioning TLS keeps the token in the file.

So the harness supplies the reading *and* the guard against reading too loosely.
`assertNotVacuous` makes a set-derived test say out loud that it found anything
at all, and `assertNoMatch` reports the line rather than just failing. Both were
already present in this suite, applied unevenly, in four files out of thirty-three.

This module is deliberately not named `test_*.py`: unittest discovery would
collect it. `test_ci_trigger_coverage.py` scans every `*.py` here, not only the
test files, so paths that move into this module stay visible to the CI trigger
check.

# its path from test_ci_trigger_coverage.py, which finds what the suite reads by
# matching the literal quoted-segment form, so adopting accessors would empty that
# scan one file at a time with nothing going red. These two stay because the walks

# Card 05 of the 2026-08-21 architecture review asked this module for four things:
# the root, `workflow()`, `script()` and the non-vacuity guard. Three of them are
# here. `script()` is the one that is deliberately absent, and a `repo_text(*parts)`
# standing in for it was removed rather than adopted.
#
# The reason is that `REPO_ROOT.joinpath(*parts)` hides the path from
# test_ci_trigger_coverage.py, which finds what the suite reads by looking for the
# literal quoted-segment form: the root constant, then each directory as its own
# quoted string. (Spelling that shape out here as an example makes this comment a
# path the scan then goes looking for -- it is derived from every `*.py` in this
# directory, this file included.) Rolling an accessor out across the suite would
# have emptied that scan file by file, and the CI trigger's coverage check would
# have gone green over a suite it could no longer see. The duplication the card
# counted is real; it is also what keeps the paths visible. Test files spell their
# paths out for that reason, and the cost is one line each.
#
# The same answer governs how far `workflow()` goes, which is the part of the card
# that looks half-finished and is not. Some files call it; the rest still parse a
# module-level constant of their own. Those constants are the declaration -- a file
# saying `REPO_ROOT / ".github" / "workflows" / "pr-test-deploy.yml"` is how the
# scan learns that file reads that workflow. Swapping them for `workflow("...")`
# would collapse fifteen named workflows into this module's `WORKFLOWS_DIR` and
# leave the trigger check unable to say which test guards which file. Nothing about
# the CI filter would go red, because `.github/workflows/**` is wide enough to hide
# it -- which is the failure mode, not the reassurance.
#
# So `workflow()` is for callers that already hold a name: iterating the directory,
# or reading a workflow a constant elsewhere already declares. It is not a
# replacement for the constants, and the eight-of-forty count is the shape this is
# meant to have rather than a migration that stalled.
