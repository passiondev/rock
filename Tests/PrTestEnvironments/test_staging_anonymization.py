"""Static checks on Deployment/Database/Invoke-StagingAnonymization.ps1.

There is no SQL Server and no PowerShell in CI, so nothing here executes the
script -- these assert the properties that make it safe to point at a real
catalog. Same approach test_legacy_text_columns.py takes, and for a sharper
reason: the converter it guards rewrites column types, while this one destroys
every email address and phone number it can reach. Aimed at the wrong catalog it
is not a failed run, it is a restore.

The script exists because staging is seeded from a production backup. On the day
it is restored it holds every congregant's real contact details, on a box whose
whole purpose is that people try things on it -- including sending a
communication. Removing the ability to reach a real person is a stronger
guarantee than everyone remembering not to press send.
