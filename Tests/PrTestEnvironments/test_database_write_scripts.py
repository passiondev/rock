"""The house rule for a script that writes to a Rock catalog, checked in one place.

`Deployment/Database` holds five scripts. Four of them write, three of those have
a test file each, and all three pin the same three properties in three different
spellings: the run is a dry run unless you ask for a write, nothing executes
before the gate that decides, and a rollback is on disk before the first
statement runs.

`Set-RockGlobalAttributeValue.ps1` is the fourth. It follows all three today --
it was written by copying the one beside it -- and nothing holds it there. It
appears in no test, no workflow and no runbook, and the next script in this
directory will be written the same way it was: by copying whichever file is
already there.

So the rule stops being three copies of an assertion about three named files and
becomes one statement about the directory. A `.ps1` added to
`Deployment/Database` is sorted by what it does, not by whether somebody
remembered to write a test for it, and it either satisfies the rule or says in
its own header why the rule does not fit.

The per-script test files stay. They assert what their script means -- which
columns the anonymizer rewrites, that `image` becomes `varbinary` and not text --
and none of that belongs here. This file holds only what is true of all of them.
