"""Static checks on the legacy-column tooling in Deployment/Database.

There is no SQL Server and no PowerShell in CI, so nothing here executes either
script -- these assert the properties that make them safe to hand to an operator
pointed at a real catalog, which is exactly the situation where a mistake is not
recoverable. Same approach the rest of this suite takes to the .ps1 files.

The scripts exist because the 2026-08-18 v19 deploy died on
"The data types text and nvarchar are incompatible in the equal to operator".
`text`, `ntext` and `image` were deprecated in SQL Server 2005 and removed in
2016; Rock's own schema uses `nvarchar`, so a column of that type in a Passion
catalog is local drift, and a v19 migration that compares one with `=` fails.
Finding them needs a read; fixing them needs a write against production-derived
data, which is why they are two scripts and not one.
