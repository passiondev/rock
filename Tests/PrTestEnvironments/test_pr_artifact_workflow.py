    r"""`ptp-14803-build-artifact.yml` exists because it cannot reach anything.

    The architecture review recommended deleting it, on two grounds. Neither holds,
    and the record is here rather than in a commit message because the same two
    readings are what an automated scan produces.

    A second review then recommended it again -- retire the file, or make it call
    the artifact build with inputs -- which is how this docstring learned it was
    the wrong place to keep the answer. The decision is ADR-0009 now; what follows
    is why, and the tests below are what hold it.

    "Nobody triggers it." It was pinned to `push: [deploy/ptp-14803-18.4.1]`, a
    branch on the prune list, which is a real problem and is fixed -- it is dispatch
    only now, pinned by test_workflow_triggers_survive_pruning.py. The capability was
    last used on 2026-08-18 against a different branch entirely.

    "Fifteen of its nineteen steps are the same as the artifact build's." Nine are.
    The count of fifteen comes from matching step titles; six of those fifteen differ
    in substance, and the differences are the reason both files exist. The artifact
    build pins a SHA and fetches depth 10, restores `RockWeb\packages.config` into a
    named packages directory, caches five node_modules trees, and sorts build
    failures into required and advisory. This one takes whatever branch you dispatch,
    builds a fixed list of seven projects, and hard-fails on any of them. The nine
    that do match are not contiguous in either file, because the artifact build also
    compiles Rock.JavaScript and Rock.JavaScript.EditorJs in between -- so a shared
    prelude action would have to either carry those for both or split into three
    fragments, and neither is a deeper module than what is there.

    What is worth pinning is the property that makes deleting it a loss: it consumes
    no credentials, so it cannot boot Rock against the production catalog. That is a
    claim its header makes at length and nothing enforced.
