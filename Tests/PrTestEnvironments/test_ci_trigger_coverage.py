"""The suite only guards a file if changing that file runs the suite.

`deployment-pipeline-tests.yml` filters on `paths:`, so a file the suite reads but
the filter does not list is tested on every run except the one that matters. The
workflow's own comment claimed that gap had been closed by naming parent
directories. It had not: on 2026-08-19 four read paths sat outside the list, the
worst being `.github/pr-test-environments.json` -- the base-branch pin a trunk
cutover flips, guarded by test_base_branch_config.py, and editing it ran nothing.

This is the third time the same hole has been found. `.github/scripts/**` had to be
added because `pr-test-status.js` lives there and `scripts` is a sibling of
`workflows`, not a child of it. `Deployment/**` replaced `Deployment/PrTestEnvironments/**`
because `Deployment/Repository/set-trunk-protection.sh` sat outside the narrower glob.
Both were then fixed by hand and pinned with a hand-kept list of required paths --
which is why the third gap went unnoticed: a hand-kept list only knows what somebody
remembered to add to it, and it cannot fail for a path nobody thought of.

So this file derives the required set from the test sources instead. A new test that
reads somewhere new fails here until the trigger is widened to match, whether or not
anyone remembers this file exists. That only works while test files write their paths
out in the literal `REPO_ROOT / "a" / "b"` form, which is ADR-0003 and is the reason
pipeline_harness.py exports two directory constants rather than five.

It replaces PipelineTestTriggerTests in
test_environment_deploy.py, whose literal-membership assertion also had the inverse
failure mode: it fired on a change that widened a glob to a parent directory and so
strictly improved coverage.
