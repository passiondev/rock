"""The suite's own conventions, pinned the same way it pins everything else.

Forty test files read the same tree, and for most of the suite's life each one
re-derived where that tree was: `pathlib.Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]`,
copied thirty-three times. The copies agreed, so nothing was visibly wrong. What
made it worth undoing is the failure mode when they stop agreeing -- move the
suite one directory and `parents[2]` does not raise, it resolves to a different
directory, and every test that reads from it goes looking for files that are not
there. Some of those tests assert a file's contents and would fail loudly. Others
scan a tree and assert on what they find, and an empty tree is a green run.

So the root is derived once, in `pipeline_harness`, and these tests keep it that
way.
