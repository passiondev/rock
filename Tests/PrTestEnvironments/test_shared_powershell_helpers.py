"""Hold the copied PowerShell helpers identical across the deploy scripts.

`Deployment/PrTestEnvironments/` holds twelve PowerShell scripts and no shared
module. Several carry the same helper functions, copied rather than shared. That
is on purpose, and ADR-0001 has the three reasons. The short form: the bootstrap
publishes with a `*.ps1` glob that no `.psm1` matches, a half-applied publish would
break every command on the VM rather than one, and the copy in the VM startup
script runs before any module could reach the machine.

Two architecture reviews have proposed the module anyway. Both read the code, and
neither had a way to reach the reasoning, which is why it is an ADR now.

What the decision was missing is any check that the copies agree, which is what
this module is. Bodies are compared after whitespace is normalised, because the
bootstrap copy lives in a YAML here-string at a different indent with `$` escaped
as a backtick-dollar.
