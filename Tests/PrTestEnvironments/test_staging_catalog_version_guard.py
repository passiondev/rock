"""The staging deploy must refuse a Rock *minor* change while it is still sharing
the sandbox catalog with the pr-* fleet.

Written after the 2026-08-18 v19 staging deploy. `vars.STAGING_DB_NAME` was never
set, so `db_name` resolved empty and fell back to the prod-derived shared catalog
(`DB_NAME_SOURCE: shared sandbox fallback (secrets.DB_NAME)` in run 32127109855).
Rock migrates at Application_Start, so a 19.3.4 artifact pointed at an 18.4.1
catalog started migrating it the moment IIS served the first request. A core EF
migration then died on `The data types text and nvarchar are incompatible in the
equal to operator`, which rolled back that one migration and left every migration
before it committed -- a catalog stranded between two minors, and the shared one.

pr-test-deploy.yml already refuses this. staging-deploy.yml carried the invariant
only as a header comment and a `::warning::`, and a warning does not stop a deploy.

The guard is tested by *running* it rather than by matching the YAML, because what
matters is the exit code for a given combination of catalog and version -- a shape
assertion would have passed against a guard that printed the right words and
exited 0."""
