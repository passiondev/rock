<#
    Which site a deploy acts on is the single most consequential decision
    Deploy-RockEnvironment.ps1 makes, and until now it was thirty lines of
    top-level script that nothing could call.

    Two of its outcomes are unrecoverable if wrong. Deploying InPlace to the
    wrong path overwrites a live site. Writing the manifest under
    $EnvironmentRoot puts production into the tree the certificate renewal job
    walks -- and that job stops and starts every site it finds a manifest for,
    so a misplaced manifest turns a routine renewal into a production outage.
    The comment in the script has always said "never under $EnvironmentRoot".
    Nothing checked it.

    These run against the shipped function body, loaded by AST so the script
    itself never executes.

    On paths, and why none of these use a drive letter: Join-Path resolves the
    qualifier through the provider, so on a Linux runner `Join-Path 'C:\x' 'y'`
    finds no drive C and returns $null. An assertion written with Windows
    literals then compares $null to $null and passes having checked nothing.
    Every path here is built from $TestDrive for that reason, and every one is
    asserted non-empty before it is compared. It does mean these tests cannot
    speak to Windows path semantics; they check which root a path is composed
    from, which is where the damage lives.
