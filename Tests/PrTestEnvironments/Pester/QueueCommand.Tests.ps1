<#
    Six workflows put a command on the VM queue. Two of them echo the command
    into a public Actions log, and the command carries a SQL connection string
    with a plaintext password.

    Both echo loops were written as `if ($key -eq 'connectionString')`. The
    deploy producer calls the same secret `sandboxConnectionString`, so had it
    ever grown an echo -- by the ordinary route of copying a sibling that has
    one -- the password would have gone straight into a public log. The queue
    agent on the VM has redacted both names since it was written
    (Invoke-PrEnvironmentCommandQueue.ps1, Get-CommandSecrets). Only the
    workflow half knew one name.

    So this suite is not about tidying six similar steps into one. It is about a
    redaction rule that has to hold for a field name nobody has thought of yet.
