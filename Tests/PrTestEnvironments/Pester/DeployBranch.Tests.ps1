    The two things a deploy can be, and the order each one does them in.

    Until these functions existed the whole deploy ran as top-level script.
    Import-ScriptFunction lifts function definitions, so nothing under Pester
    could reach any of it: 379 tests stopped at the last function, and the only
    coverage the ordering had was Python tests matching substrings of the script's
    own source. Those assert what the file says. They cannot assert what it does,
    and the difference is not academic -- the extraction that made this file
    possible exposed a cross-branch variable read that had been a terminating
    error on the production rollback path the whole time, under 132 text checks
    that never saw it.

    Ordering is what is tested here because ordering is what is dangerous.

    Invoke-DedicatedSiteReplace
        Between the wipe and the restore the site does not exist. Every read that
        has to happen before that window must have happened before it, and every
        write that repairs it must come after -- in the right order among
        themselves, because the shared-asset overlay fills gaps only and the
        server-owned pass replaces. Run the second one first and it is a no-op
        that logs a successful restore.

    Invoke-InPlaceOverlay
        The branch production uses. It reads the migration log and copies the site
        aside before it writes anything, because both are worthless afterwards.
        Orphan reconciliation happens while the pool is still stopped and nothing
        holds a lock on bin.

    Both hand back one record with the same two fields. That is asserted here
    directly: it is what lets the deploy body ask "is there a backup" instead of
    asking which branch ran, and a stray emitter anywhere inside either function
    would break it silently -- robocopy's job summary alone is forty lines.
