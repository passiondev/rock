<#
    Three checks that all exist because of the same mistake, made in three places:
    believing a deploy succeeded on evidence that does not actually say so.

    Assert-DeployedCoreVersion
        robocopy reports success for a run in which individual files were skipped.
        bin\Rock.dll is the file most likely to be locked and least survivable to
        skip, and nothing downstream notices -- the old core assembly may well
        start, leaving a site that is half one Rock version and half another.

    Invoke-DeploySmokeCheck
        Test-EnvironmentHealth passing means the app domain started and routes a
        request. On 2026-09-14 that reasoning was applied to a 302 and reported
        as "site is up at 0.045s"; the 302 was a Cloudflare maintenance rule
        answered at the edge, and Rock was returning 500 to everything behind it.
        __VIEWSTATE is the cheapest proof that Rock itself rendered the response:
        every ASP.NET WebForms page emits it, and nothing that is not ASP.NET
        does.

    Get-MigrationFingerprint
        The backup covers the file system. Rock migrates the database on first
        request after a deploy, so once migrations have run, restoring files
        alone leaves old binaries against a new schema -- a worse state than the
        one being rolled back from. The rollback advice had no way to know that
        and said "roll back from $backupPath" either way.

        already sitting in the bucket.

        RockApplication.csv and MigrationLog.csv; the filter was '*.log', which
        matched none of them and picked up a stale Rock.log from an older logging
        config instead, so the report carried year-old Twilio webhook noise and
        none of the startup failure.
