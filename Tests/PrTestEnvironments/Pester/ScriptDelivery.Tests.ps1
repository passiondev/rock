<#
    The agent refreshes its own deployment scripts from bootstrap/latest on every
    poll, and eight tests in test_command_queue_self_update.py say so. All eight
    read the source text. None of them fetched anything, and the refresh had never
    delivered a file in its life.

    gsutil types a .ps1 as application/octet-stream. Invoke-WebRequest returns
    .Content as a byte[] for every content type outside the text, JSON and XML
    families, so Read-GcsObjectText returned bytes where its one caller wanted
    text. The parse check then rejected the byte[] rendered as "35 32 82 111 ..."
    and kept the copy on disk, per file, per poll, warning to a stream nothing
    collects. The command queue was unaffected the whole time because command
    objects are written as application/json -- same function, same VM, opposite
    outcome, which is why this survived every green run.

    Measured 2026-08-24: a script published straight to bootstrap/latest did not
    reach the VM across two dispatches 36 minutes apart.

    These tests call the functions. A structural test cannot tell a byte[] from a
    string, and that distinction was the entire defect.

        "the refresh has never delivered a file to connect-srv-test" stood for
        weeks as a claim nobody could check: there was no artifact that would
        distinguish not delivering from not being watched.

        These pin the artifact. Deploy-RockEnvironment.ps1 reads it back and puts
        it in the deploy timeline -- see Write-DeployScriptProvenance -- so the
        next deploy after a refresh says out loud which copy of the script is
        running and when it last changed.
