<#
    Everything an organisation has ever changed about a legacy LESS theme lives
    in two files: _variable-overrides.less and _css-overrides.less. Upstream
    ships an empty pair in every theme and never touches them again.

    Production's copies carry the brand palette and the Pro Font Awesome wiring.
    The artifact's copies carry neither, and they have the same names, so both
    deployment modes get them wrong in opposite directions unless something
    intervenes -- InPlace overwrites production's with upstream's empty pair, and
    the DedicatedSite overlay skips production's because the artifact already put
    a file there. That is why staging renders in stock Rock blue.

    Get-ServerOwnedThemeFilePaths is what both modes ask, and the property that
    makes it safe to use as a robocopy exclusion is that it only ever returns
    paths that exist. A path returned for a theme the server does not have would
    exclude that theme's override file from the copy, and theme.less imports the
    file unconditionally, so the theme would stop compiling altogether.

    These run against the shipped function body, loaded by AST so the script
    itself never executes. Paths are built from $TestDrive: Join-Path resolves
    the qualifier through the provider, so a Windows literal on a Linux runner
    returns $null and an assertion comparing $null to $null passes having checked
    nothing.

        The restore pass was written for Assets/Fonts/FontAwesome, a directory.
        The theme overrides are single files inside directories the artifact owns
        and keeps writing, so they cannot be handled the same way.

        robocopy takes two directories and an optional file filter. Pointing it at
        a file as though it were a directory does not fail loudly -- it reports a
        result and moves nothing -- so the split between the two shapes is the
        whole of the behaviour, and getting it wrong leaves staging on stock Rock
        blue with a deploy log that says the restore succeeded.

        robocopy does not exist off Windows, so it is stubbed here and the call is
        captured. That checks how the shipped function invokes it, which is where
        this can go wrong; it does not check what robocopy then does with those

Describe 'Resolve-SharedAssetSource' {

    <#
        The plan and the apply run both need to know which site the overlay reads
        from, and they used to work it out separately. The apply run fell back to
        the Default Web Site when nothing was configured -- the normal case -- and
        the plan did not, so the plan reported "none found" for a run that would
        restore eight files.

        The Get-Command guard is the part worth testing here. -ErrorAction does not
        suppress a missing cmdlet: CommandNotFoundException is raised before any
        parameter is bound. Without the guard this function throws on any machine
        without the IIS module, which is every machine these tests run on, and the
        dry run now calls it.
