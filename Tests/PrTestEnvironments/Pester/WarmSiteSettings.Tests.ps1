    What the deploy leaves the staging and production site set to.

    Until 2026-08-26 the deploy set an app pool's runtime version and identity and
    stopped, so every other IIS default stood. Staging measured 16.07s for a first
    request and 0.25s for the next one that day. The machine did not change between
    those two numbers: IIS had ended the worker process after twenty idle minutes
    and the first visitor paid for a whole Rock start.

    These run the function rather than reading it, for the reason
    CertificateSelection.Tests.ps1 gives. A substring assertion can see that
    "idleTimeout" is written down somewhere in the file. It cannot see what value
    reached IIS, and the value is the entire point.

    Set-WarmSiteSettings is separate from Ensure-AppPool so that production can
    reach it. An InPlace deploy updates a site somebody else built, so it never
    calls Ensure-AppPool and never should -- restating a live site's identity is
    not a performance change. The last Context here is the one that holds that
    split in place.

    Deploy-PrEnvironment.ps1 is not covered, and gets none of this. Holding a dozen
    PR pools resident on one 32GB box is not the trade holding one staging pool is.
