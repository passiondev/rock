<#
    The deploy timeline is the only record of a production cutover, and until this
    suite existed it was not durable.

    Measured on the staging rehearsal of 2026-08-25 (command
    deploy-staging-32794680054-1): the deploy succeeded, ran 15m24s, and uploaded a
    916-byte log covering the first 2m38s. It stops on the line

        [2026-08-25T01:11:44Z +00:02:38] Stopping app pool rock-staging. The site is offline from here.

    followed by five blank lines and nothing else. Every step after it -- the site
    replace, the ACL grant, the preserved-file restore, the app pool start, the
    health check, "Done." -- executed, because the command reported success and that
    requires reaching the end of the try block. All of it was lost between the job
    and the bucket.

    The cause was not redaction (a literal .Replace guarded on length), the 200000
    character cap (tail-preserving, and the log was 916 bytes), a timeout (1800s
    allowed against a 924s run), a preference change (there is none), a stale script
    (the GCS and repository copies matched on md5), or a second agent instance (both
    objects were metageneration 1, written 256ms apart). It is the job stream itself
    dropping records.

    So these tests do not assert anything about the stream. Write-DeployStep writes
    the timeline to a file on the box, which is ordinary I/O and cannot be dropped by
    whatever the stream is doing, and the agent appends that file to whatever the
    capture gave it. The fix is deliberately indifferent to the mechanism, because
    the mechanism is still unexplained and the production cutover is not waiting on
    an explanation.
