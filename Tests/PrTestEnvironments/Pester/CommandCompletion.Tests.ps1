<#
    The command object in pending/ is the only thing deciding whether a command
    runs once or runs forever. The agent lists that prefix every sixty seconds and
    takes whatever is there, so a command is retired by being deleted and by
    nothing else.

    Until this suite existed, the agent finished a command like this:

        Write-GcsObjectText -ObjectName $resultObject -Text $resultJson
        Remove-GcsObject -ObjectName $commandObject

    Two statements, no try/catch, under $ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'. Any failure
    of the first skips the second. The command stays pending, the scheduled task
    fires a minute later, and the same command runs again -- and again, for as long
    as the box is up. On a `deploy-environment` command that means re-extracting the
    site and re-entering migrations on top of a run already in progress.

    A transient 503 is enough to start it. Nothing has to be misconfigured.

    So the write is retried and the delete happens either way. The failure that
    trades down to is the dispatching workflow polling until it times out with no
    result: a false red on work that ran exactly once, which is recoverable by
    reading a log. The behaviour it replaces is not recoverable by anything.

    These tests call the real function with the network edge mocked, because the
    distinction being asserted -- did the delete still happen -- is invisible to a
    test that reads source text.
