"""Every local composite action is on disk before the step that uses it.

`uses: ./.github/actions/x` does not fetch anything. It reads the working tree, so
a job referencing a local action without having run `actions/checkout` first fails
with "Can't find 'action.yml'" -- at the step, after the deploy has already been
queued. Nothing in GitHub's own validation catches it, and it is invisible in
review because the checkout that makes it work is usually somewhere else in the
file.

Most of these jobs check out sparsely, which adds a second way to get it wrong:
the checkout succeeds, the action directory is simply not in the sparse list, and
the failure is identical. `env-deploy-command.yml` checked out twice for this
reason before the two were folded together.

Card 02 of the 2026-08-21 architecture review moved six copies of the
command-queue wait, and then six copies of the enqueue, into two actions. That
took the number of local action references from two to fourteen. This module is
what makes that safe to keep doing.

    the action would have run is skipped and the job dies at the `uses:` line.
