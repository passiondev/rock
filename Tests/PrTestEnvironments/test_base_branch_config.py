# that diff found.
#
# It stayed at 18.4.1 across the 19.3.4 -> 19.4.4 move, which looks wrong until you

# staging and superseded before its own cutover, so production's jump is 18.4.1 ->
# 19.4.4 in one step and 18.4.1 is still the branch on the old side of it. This key
# names the trunk production is coming *from*, not the previous value of the one
# above.
#
# It earns a pin of its own because the two constants above stop disagreeing at
# cutover. Before v19 shipped, productionBranch was passion-18.4.1 and the fetch loop in
# deployment-pipeline-tests.yml picked the old trunk up for free. Repointing production
# to v19 took the last reference to 18.4.1 out of the config, the loop stopped fetching

    applies EF and plugin migrations at Application_Start, so a catalog shared
    across two Rock minors gets migrated out from under whichever site started
    first -- that is what put pr-3 on a permanent HTTP 500 on 2026-08-11, and what

    catalog to be shared as well is what made staging unusable as the place to find
    out whether the next minor migrates cleanly.

    So staging and the fleet now name separate variables and fall back to the same
    catalog. Unset, they resolve identically and the 2026-08-17 arrangement holds
    unchanged; set one and exactly one environment moves. What keeps two minors off
