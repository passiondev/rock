"""Production has no agent, and the one thing that installs an agent is aimed at staging.

`production-deploy.yml` queues its command to `commands-prod`. Nothing polls that
prefix. `connect-srv-prod` carries no `windows-startup-script-ps1`, no scheduled
task, and a service account scoped to `devstorage.read_only` -- which cannot write
the result object the deploy workflow then waits for. A production deploy dispatched
today queues a command that is never read and polls for a result that is never
written, until it times out.

`pr-test-bootstrap-command-queue.yml` is the only thing in the repository that
installs the agent, and it resolves its VM from `GCP_VM_EXTERNAL_IP` -- the test box.
Pointing it at production would also hand production staging's queue and staging's
scripts.

So there are two halves here, and they fail differently:

  * The queue name is already a parameter, so production gets its own commands.
    The *script source* is not: `$BootstrapPrefix` is a hardcoded literal, so a
    production agent would refresh itself once a minute from the prefix the staging
    bootstrap publishes -- an unreviewed staging script would reach production
    within 60 seconds of being uploaded. BootstrapPrefixIsolationTests covers that.

  * Nothing installs the agent on production at all.
    ProductionBootstrapWorkflowTests covers that.
