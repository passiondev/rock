"""Static checks on the theme-customization path: script, queue arm, workflow.

Nothing here executes anything. There is no SQL Server in CI, no PowerShell job
that reaches a catalog, and no Rock instance to render against -- so these assert
the properties that make the path safe to point at production's catalog on
cutover day, and the properties that keep the three pieces pointing at each other.

WHAT THIS GUARDS

The internal site's branding is stored in two halves. The .less half is committed
and ships in every artifact. The other half is one column on one row --
Theme.AdditionalSettingsJson -- and it is per-catalog, so no deploy carries it
anywhere. It reached staging by somebody typing it into Admin Tools, which is
exactly the kind of value that exists in one place and is discovered missing by
looking at a stock-blue production site.

Set-RockThemeCustomization.ps1 is the reproducible form of that hand edit, and
the v19 cutover is when it gets used in anger: migration
202508051740308_Rollup_20250805 repoints the internal site at the RockNextGen
theme unconditionally, so production starts rendering from a row whose
customization column is empty.

WHY THE CROSS-LANGUAGE ASSERTIONS ARE HERE

Two values in the PowerShell script are copies of C# facts -- the settings key
and the two purposes that consume customization. Both fail silently when they
drift: a wrong key writes valid JSON to a property Rock never reads, and a wrong
purpose list downgrades a "this will not be visible" warning into silence. The
run reports success either way. So the tests read the C# and compare.
