# ADR-0007: The diagnose run reaches the VM through the startup script, not the command queue

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-09-15
- **Governs:** `.github/workflows/pr-test-diagnose-command-queue.yml`
- **Enforced by:** `Tests/PrTestEnvironments/test_diagnostics_workflow.py`, `.github/workflows/pr-test-diagnose-command-queue.yml`

## Context

Six workflows put a command on the queue and wait for it, and since
`queue-vm-command` and `await-vm-command` were written they all do it the same
way. One workflow that touches the same VM does not: the diagnose run writes a
PowerShell payload into the instance's `windows-startup-script-ps1` metadata,
reboots the box, and polls a `pr-environments/diagnostics/` object for the
transcript.

From the workflow directory that reads as the last un-migrated caller, and an
architecture review proposed migrating it: replace the inline steps with the two
queue actions. It is the obvious move, it will be proposed again, and it does not
work.

## Decision

The diagnose run keeps the startup script and its own poll. It is not migrated
onto `queue-vm-command` and `await-vm-command`, and a future review that counts
callers and finds one missing should read this before proposing the migration
again. What it does share with its siblings is shared, one behaviour at a time.

## Why

It exists to diagnose a queue agent that is not running. That is the whole of its
job: it lists what is stranded in `pending/`, `processing/` and `results/`, dumps
`Get-ScheduledTask` and `Get-ScheduledTaskInfo` for the agent's task, then runs
`Invoke-PrEnvironmentCommandQueue.ps1` once by hand and prints the exit code.
Delivering that through the queue means the diagnosis arrives only when the thing
being diagnosed already works, and stays stuck in `pending/` in precisely the case
it was built for.

There is also no verb to send. The agent dispatches on eight -- `deploy`,
`deploy-environment`, `stop`, `destroy`, `renew-certificate`,
`find-legacy-text-columns`, `anonymize-staging` and `set-theme-customization` --
and a ninth reaches a VM only through `pr-test-bootstrap-command-queue.yml`, which
stops and starts the instance. So acquiring the ability to diagnose without a
reboot would begin with a reboot.

The startup script is the only channel this workflow has, and a startup script
runs on boot. The metadata write and the stop/start are not incidental steps
around the diagnosis; they are how it is delivered.

## Consequences

This workflow is not the cheap read-back tool its name suggests, and nothing about
keeping it off the queue makes it one. It reboots the test VM, so staging and the
whole `pr-*` fleet are down for the minutes Rock needs to warm. It overwrites
`windows-startup-script-ps1` and never restores the previous value, so the box
boots into the diagnostics payload until a bootstrap rewrites it. Run
`pr-test-bootstrap-command-queue.yml` afterwards.

What this workflow genuinely shares with its siblings has been moved out. Turning
an external IP into a name and zone is now `.github/actions/resolve-vm`, which is
where the diagnose run's `accessConfigs[0].natIP` filter and its missing
resolved-VM guard went. The poll stays its own: it waits on a diagnostics
transcript, not on a command result, so `await-vm-command` would be reading the
wrong prefix for the wrong kind of answer.

## What would reopen this

A `diagnose` verb on the agent, published to every VM, together with a channel
onto the box that does not require a boot -- working sshd, or the once-a-minute
script refresh actually delivering a file, which it never has. With both, routine
diagnosis becomes a command like any other and this workflow shrinks to the dead
agent case alone.

Failing that, if the queue ever grows claim semantics and a liveness heartbeat,
most of what this run is used for could be read out of the bucket without touching
the VM, and the workflow would not need to exist.
