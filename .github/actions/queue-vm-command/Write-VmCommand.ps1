<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Builds a VM queue command, echoes it with the secrets removed, and uploads it.

.DESCRIPTION
    The queue protocol is a JSON object dropped into
    `gs://<bucket>/pr-environments/<queue>/pending/<commandId>.json`. Six
    workflows write one, and every one of them hand-rolled the envelope, the
    drop-if-empty rules and -- in two cases -- the redaction.

    This is a script rather than PowerShell inlined into action.yml so that the
    redaction can be loaded and executed by the Pester suite. PowerShell embedded
    in YAML is a string that nothing can run until a runner expands it, which is
    how the two echo loops came to key on `connectionString` while the producer
    holding the sandbox password called the same field `sandboxConnectionString`.
    See Tests/PrTestEnvironments/Pester/QueueCommand.Tests.ps1.

    Kept to Windows PowerShell 5.1 syntax. It only ever runs on the runner's
    pwsh 7 today, but the queue agent it talks to is 5.1 and these two halves get
    read together.

function New-VmCommand {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Merges the queue envelope with a caller's payload into one ordered command.
    .PARAMETER Payload
        A JSON object of command-specific fields. Fields whose value is null or
        blank are dropped, which is what replaces the drop-if-empty branches the
        callers used to carry. A false boolean is kept: the VM reads optional
        flags as `-contains 'apply' -and $Command.apply`, so present-and-false
        behaves as absent, and keeping it records the decision in the log.
    .PARAMETER SecretField
        The field name to place SecretValue under. Two live names exist for one
        concept -- the PR fleet's `deploy` verb reads sandboxConnectionString and
        `deploy-environment` reads connectionString -- and renaming either means
        republishing the queue agent to the VM before any deploy would work.

        That is a parameter and not a constant because the two verbs are two
        contracts, which is also why the deploy path is one workflow per verb
        rather than one deploy workflow: ADR-0006. A caller that had to pick the
        field name would be the same caller deciding which script runs on the VM.

function Get-SecretFieldNamePattern {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        The shape of a command field name whose value must never reach a log.

    .DESCRIPTION
        A shape, not a list of known names. CONTEXT.md states the rule -- redaction
        keys on the shape of a field name -- because two producers once redacted
        `connectionString` while the one holding the sandbox password called the
        same thing `sandboxConnectionString`, and the log that mattered was the one
        that had never heard of the second name.

        Both halves of the queue need the identical rule: the producer redacts what
        it echoes into a public Actions log, the agent redacts what it uploads to
        the bucket, and a field name nobody has invented yet has to be covered by
        both without either being edited. Copied rather than shared, because no
        module can reach the VM (ADR-0001); test_shared_powershell_helpers.py is
        what holds the copies identical.

    .DESCRIPTION
        The name rule cannot see a password embedded in a value that arrived under
        an innocuous name, or quoted inside a line of output a deploy printed. This
        catches `password=` up to the next delimiter. The two patterns together are
        what "redacted" means on both sides of the queue, which is why they are
        named and copied as a pair.

        a password containing a quote cannot leak a fragment past a substitution.
        Two layers, matching Get-RedactedText on the queue agent: the field name,
        then the `password=` keyword as a backstop for a field the name rule
        misses.

function Assert-ValidQueueName {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Throws unless the queue name is one that can address a queue.
    .DESCRIPTION
        The name is concatenated into a GCS object path, so a name outside this
        shape writes the command somewhere no agent is polling. That failure is
        silent in the worst direction: the wait runs to its ceiling and reports a
        timeout, which reads as a dead VM rather than a misaddressed command.

        This check used to sit in a `run:` step in three workflows, one copy each,
        and callers that did not think to add it had none. Whoever builds the path
        should be the one to check it, and that is this script. The agent keeps its
        own copy on the far side, which is a different claim: this one says the
        command was addressed correctly, and that one says this VM was asked for
        work meant for it. Neither substitutes for the other.

        Deliberately the same pattern as the agent's. A producer laxer than the
        consumer can queue a command that is accepted here and ignored there.

        `-cnotmatch`, not `-notmatch`. PowerShell matches case-insensitively by
        default, so every copy of this check that existed accepted 'Commands'.
        GCS does not fold case: that command lands in `pr-environments/Commands/`
        while the agent polls `pr-environments/commands/`, and the wait reports a
        timeout for a VM that was healthy and never asked. A lowercase-only
        pattern enforced case-insensitively is the check appearing to work.

function Clear-StaleResult {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Removes a result left behind by an earlier command carrying this same id.
    .DESCRIPTION
        The command id is the whole of a command's identity. await-vm-command acts
        on the first `results/<commandId>.json` it can copy, and it has no way to
        tell this attempt's answer from one already sitting there. Nothing on the
        VM prunes results either: the agent deletes the *command* object when it
        picks the work up and leaves the result for the poller to find.

        So an id that repeats reads as an instant success or an instant failure
        that no VM produced. Every producer now puts github.run_attempt in the id,
        which is what stops the repeat. This is the half that does not depend on
        six workflows each remembering: clear the slot, then fill it.

        A result found here means two commands shared an id, which should not
        happen now. The caller says so in the log rather than passing over it.
    .OUTPUTS
        $true when a stale result was removed, $false when the slot was already
        empty, which is the normal case.
